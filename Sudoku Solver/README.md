This program solves Sudoku puzzles using a recursive backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game played on a grid, typically 9x9 in size, where the objective is to fill in the grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Sudoku Class
The Sudoku class represents the Sudoku puzzle.
It stores the game board and contains methods for solving the puzzle.
The constructor accepts a string input representing the initial state of the board.
The solve() method attempts to modify the board to find a valid solution using recursive backtracking.
Helper methods are implemented as needed to facilitate the solving process.
The game board is stored using arrays to adhere to course requirements, with the size of the board being determined by the value of n.

Application (Main) Class
The main class prompts the user to enter the initial board configuration.
It creates a Sudoku object with the input provided by the user.
The solve() method of the Sudoku object is called to attempt to find a solution.
If a solution is found, it is outputted. Otherwise, a message indicating that the provided board is unsolvable is displayed.

Input Validation
The program verifies the validity of the user-provided board.
The size of the board must be n^2 by n^2, where n is greater than 1.
If the input does not meet the requirements, the program ignores the input and starts with an empty 9x9 board.

Generalization Note
The program is designed to work for any valid value of n, allowing for flexibility in the size of the Sudoku board.
The choice of data structure and implementation ensures scalability and efficiency, allowing for the solution of larger Sudoku puzzles.

Performance Considerations
Smaller boards (e.g., 4x4 and 9x9) are solved quickly.
Larger boards may take significantly longer to solve, especially if they are partially empty.
