Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis<br>
This repository contains a Java program designed to analyze the performance of various sorting algorithms. The program implements seven different sorting algorithms:<br> insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, hybrid quick sort, and shell sort. The objective is to measure the execution time of each algorithm and evaluate whether they correctly sort the input array in ascending order.


Implemented Sorting Algorithms:<br>
Insertion Sort: A non-recursive sorting algorithm that iteratively inserts elements into their correct position in the sorted portion of the array.<br>
Bubble Sort: A non-recursive sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.<br>
Selection Sort: A non-recursive sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the beginning.<br>
Merge Sort: A recursive sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts each half independently, and then merges the sorted halves.<br>
Quick Sort: A recursive sorting algorithm that partitions the array into smaller sub-arrays based on a chosen pivot element, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.<br>
Hybrid Quick Sort: A modified version of the Quick Sort algorithm that switches to Insertion Sort for small sub-arrays, aiming to improve performance.<br>
Shell Sort: A non-recursive sorting algorithm that uses a sequence of decreasing gaps to sort elements at a distance apart.<br>


Sorting Analysis Report:<br>
Please refer to the separate report file (sorting_report.txt) for detailed answers to the following questions:<br>

Was insertion sort faster than selection sort? Why or why not?<br>
Was quick sort faster than insertion sort? Why or why not?<br>
Was hybrid quick sort faster than quick sort? Why or why not?<br>
Which sort(s) would you recommend to others, and why?<br>
Which sort(s) would you warn others against using, and why?<br>
