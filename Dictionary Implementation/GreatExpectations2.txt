It was a dark and stormy night
The rain fell in torrents
Except at occasional intervals
When it was checked by a violent gust of wind
Which swept up the streets
For it is in London that our scene lies
Rattling along the housetops
And fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
